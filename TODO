Before 0.1.0 (first public release):
•Given the number of dimensions, number of points, and jumbling method, draw some sort of graph showing how well the points fill space. ✓
•Sort the primes, probably by the average term in the continued fraction expansion of the quadratic irrational, so that quads which work badly together are at the end. ✓

Before 0.2.0:
•Investigate constructing continued fractions with long periods and small terms.
•Given a set of quadratic irrationals, compute integer coefficients which produce a result very close to an integer. This set of coefficients corresponds to a plane in the hypercube.
