Before 0.1.0 (first public release):
•Given the number of dimensions, number of points, and jumbling method, draw some sort of graph showing how well the points fill space. ✓
•Sort the primes, probably by the average term in the continued fraction expansion of the quadratic irrational, so that quads which work badly together are at the end. ✓

Before 0.1.1:
•Make an interactive mode, which can be used by other programs in any language. ✓
•Draw flower diagrams of individual dimensions of a sequence. ✓

Before 0.2.0:
•Add a Halton mode to the generator. ✓

Before 0.2.1:
•Compute the discrepancy of a flower plot. ✓
•Graph the discrepancy of a sequence versus the number of points. ✓

Before 0.3.0:
•Investigate constructing continued fractions with long periods and small terms. ✓
•Investigate all equivalence classes of quadratic irrationals based on the square root of a prime, where two irrationals are equivalent if their continued fraction tails are identical, with possibly different head lengths.
•Given a set of quadratic irrationals, compute integer coefficients which produce a result very close to an integer. This set of coefficients corresponds to a plane in the hypercube.
