Quadlods is a library for making low-discrepancy sequences using quadratic irrationals, which are approximated with multiple-precision rationals.

To compile, if you're not developing the program:
1. Create a subdirectory build/ inside the directory where you untarred the source code.
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make

If you are developing the program:
1. Create a directory build/quadlods outside the directory where you cloned the source code.
2. cd build/quadlods
3. cmake <directory where the source code is>
4. make

GMP is required both to compile and to run the library. To compile your own code that uses the library, first run "make install" as root.

A program called "quadlods" accompanies the library.
