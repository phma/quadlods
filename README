Quadlods is a library for making low-discrepancy sequences using quadratic irrationals, which are approximated with multiple-precision rationals.

Quadlods can generate sequences up to 6542 dimensions (the number of primes less than 65536), but some pairs of primes give particularly bad distributions with high discrepancy. The primes are sorted by the maximum continued fraction term. Use at most 3624 dimensions to avoid the bad pair (13691,13693).

To compile, if you're not developing the program:
1. Create a subdirectory build/ inside the directory where you untarred the source code.
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make

If you are developing the program:
1. Create a directory build/quadlods outside the directory where you cloned the source code.
2. cd build/quadlods
3. cmake <directory where the source code is>
4. make

It makes a file called primes.dat, which contains the primes in order of their continued fraction terms, and installs it in share/quadlods/.

GMP is required both to compile and to run the library. To compile your own code that uses the library, first run "make install" as root. If you are using CMake, put the provided file FindQuadlods.cmake in your project's cmake/Modules directory, along with the GMP and GMPXX modules, and add the following lines to your CMakeLists.txt file:

set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/Modules/")
find_package(Quadlods REQUIRED)
set(LIBS ${LIBS} ${Quadlods_LIBRARY} ${GMP_LIBRARY} ${GMPXX_LIBRARIES})
target_link_libraries(<project> ${LIBS})
include_directories(${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR} ${Quadlods_INCLUDE_DIR})

A program called "quadlods" accompanies the library.
