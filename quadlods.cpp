/* quadlods.cpp
 * Quadratic low-discrepancy sequence
 * 
 * This generates sequences of vectors, up to 6542-dimensional, as follows:
 * Each prime is assigned to a dimension: 2 to the 0th, 3 to the 1st, etc.
 * If the prime is congruent to 1 mod 4, take (sqrt(p)+1)/2, else sqrt(p).
 * Add the quadratic number to an accumulator mod 1.
 * Copy the accumulator and exclusive-or it with 0x...9669699669969669.
 * Assemble a vector of all these accumulators xored with the bit pattern.
 * 
 * The quadratic numbers are approximated by rational numbers whose denominator
 * is at least some specified limit. The exclusive-oring is done in such a way
 * that the result will not exceed the denominator.
